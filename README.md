# Nano Studio 🚀

Transform simple smartphone product photos into studio-quality, culturally rich marketing assets — instantly. 📸✨

Nano Studio aims to democratize high-quality product photography for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs), particularly those selling authentic traditional goods (e.g., kanga, kikoy, Swahili crafts, local packaged foods). We provide a tool that transforms simple smartphone product snapshots into professional, culturally rich, and visually compelling marketing assets instantly.

## How it works 🧠🖼️
Nano Studio utilizes Google's "Nano Banana" — the official Gemini 2.5 Flash Image generation and editing model — to combine an uploaded product image with a detailed, text-based background prompt.

- You upload a product snapshot 📷
- You describe the desired background or vibe using natural language 📝
- The model composes a studio-grade image that blends your product with an authentic, evocative backdrop in seconds ⚡

"Nano Banana" (Gemini 2.5 Flash Image) uses conversational prompts to make consistent, high-quality edits to photos — changing colors, adding objects, altering textures, and more — while preserving realism and product integrity.

## Why it matters 💡
The core value proposition is the ability to generate studio-quality images with authentic, evocative backdrops in seconds, at minimal cost. This is especially impactful for SMEs and local artisans seeking:

- Professional-looking product photos without hiring a studio 💼
- Fast turnarounds for campaigns and catalogs ⏱️
- Context-rich visuals that reflect cultural authenticity 🌍
